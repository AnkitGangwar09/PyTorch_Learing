⭐ PyTorch Fundamentals 

Hands-on implementation of the complete PyTorch training workflow.

📌 Overview

This repository contains practical project while learning PyTorch.

The notebook is implemented on Google Colab for smooth GPU support and easy experimentation.

ALL About PART 1:

🚀 What’s Inside 
1. Data Preparation

Creating synthetic data

Converting data into PyTorch tensors

Splitting into training & testing sets

2. Model Pipeline

Defining a simple model using nn.Module

Choosing loss function and optimizer

Building the training loop

Implementing a testing/validation loop

Plotting loss curves and understanding model performance

3. Model Persistence

Saving the trained model

Loading the saved model

Verifying loaded model performs the same as before saving

📊 Results

Observed steady decline in loss, showing successful learning

Successfully tested the model on unseen data

Verified model reusability after saving/loading



🎯 Goal

This project is the first step in my PyTorch journey.
Next, I will explore:

Building more complex neural networks

Activation functions

Multi-layer perceptrons

Image datasets (MNIST/CIFAR)

🛠️ Tech Used

Python

PyTorch

Google Colab

Matplotlib / NumPy
